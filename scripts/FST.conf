#   NOTE: configured for use in conjunction with 2DSFS.sh
#   If you haven't run that yet, run that first
#   If you already have run ANGSD to obtain a 2DSFS, 
#   make sure you have these files named in this way:
#   POP1_SFS=${RESULTS_DIR}/${TAXON1}_Intergenic_Conditioned
#   POP2_SFS=${RESULTS_DIR}/${TAXON2}_Intergenic_Conditioned
#   INTERSECT=${RESULTS_DIR}/intersect.${TAXON1}.${TAXON2}_intergenic.txt
#   2DSFS=${RESULTS_DIR}/2DSFS_Intergenic.${TAXON1}.${TAXON2}.sfs

#   You will already have these if you run 2DSFS.sh beforehand

#   ngsFST specific configuration variables go in this file.
#   common configuration variables are in common.conf

#   If you would like to change the default parameters of the analysis,
#   you may declare the appropriate variables below.
#   See NGS_FST.sh for all possible parameters and their defaults

#   Make sure your taxa are in the same order as they were in 2DSFS.sh
