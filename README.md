#angsd-wrapper
=============

Wrapper scripts and documentation to make angsd easier to use.

Forked from [Arun Durvasula](https://github.com/arundurvasula/angsd-wrapper) in an attempt to simplify the angsd-wrapper package

To read about why I'm doing this, look no further than this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/mojaveazure/ce8c41440805be16c09c).

**NOTE: [ANGSD](https://github.com/angsd/angsd) requires BAM files to have the "@HD" header line. If your BAM files do not have this line, this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/mojaveazure/d194c4705642eecf8437) will add one.**

### To Use

Basic usage is to run the `angsd-wrapper.sh` script, specify a wrapper, and tell it where the config file is. Default config files are found in the [`Configuration_Files`](https://github.com/mojaveazure/angsd-wrapper/tree/master/Configuration_Files) directory; please modify to suit your samples. Running `angsd-wrapper.sh` without any arguments will spit out a usage message.

### Dependencies

This pacakge requires [ANGSD](https://github.com/angsd/angsd), [ngsPopGen](https://github.com/mfumagalli/ngsPopGen), and [ngsF](https://github.com/fgvieira/ngsF) for various methods. Please download and install before use. Note, it is not necessary to put these in your `PATH` as long as the directories to each of these programs is specified in the configuration files.

Please see the configuration file for your desired method to see which of these dependencies are required for that specific method.
